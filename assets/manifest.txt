Create a simple manifest listing the assets (SVGs / PNGs) you may later include (placeholders for now):

logo.svg
grid-bg.svg
scanline.png
neon-ring.svg
holo-overlay.png
Notes for PART B-2
fetchGithub for Ultra will be in src/lib/githubUltra.js (I will provide in PART B-3). Ultra fetcher includes more detailed stats and optional per-repo commit retrieval (with safeguards and caching).

Keep images in assets/ and reference via relative paths when you add real assets.

Files are intentionally modular so you can swap or extend scenes and UI elements.
