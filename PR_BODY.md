# Cyber Statics — Ultra (Cinematic Neon Edition)

This PR adds a premium Remotion project that generates cinematic GitHub statistics videos for a GitHub profile (default: AshrafMorningstar).

Highlights:
- Multi-scene cinematic composition (Hero, Timeline, Spotlight)
- Language ring with layered neon arcs
- Star distribution visualizer
- Holographic overlays, parallax layers, and glow effects
- Configurable heavy fetch (per-repo commit counts) — disabled by default
- Multi-resolution outputs: 1080p & 720p via GitHub Actions
- Offline fixture for development

How to run:
npm ci
npm run start
npm run render:1080 # or npm run render:720


Notes:
- Provide `PERSONAL_TOKEN` in repo secrets for higher rate limits.
- The Ultra pipeline may be computationally heavy — prefer Actions for final renders.
